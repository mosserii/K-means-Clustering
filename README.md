# Implementation of a normalized spectral clustering machine learning algorithm. This was a very large scale programming challenge for me. I implemented it in C in order to get the best execution time in code and added a python API so it will be easy to use. 
# The algorithm's input is N vectors of dimension d, I used very complex mathematical theories to cluster them into k different clusters according to Euclidian distances.
